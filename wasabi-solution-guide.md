# Wasabi Video Access Solution Guide

## Current Issue
Your Wasabi account has **account-level restrictions** that prevent:
1. Public access to objects (even with bucket policies)
2. Presigned URLs from working (returning 403 Forbidden)

## Root Cause
The error message "Public use of objects is not allowed by this account" indicates that Wasabi has disabled public access at the **account level**, which overrides any bucket-level policies or presigned URL attempts.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Enable Public Access at Account Level (Recommended)
1. **Contact Wasabi Support**: Email support@wasabi.com
2. **Request**: Ask them to enable public access for your account
3. **Reason**: Explain you need to serve video files publicly for your web application
4. **Alternative**: Check your Wasabi console for account-level settings

### Option 2: Use Wasabi's CDN (Content Delivery Network)
1. **Enable Wasabi CDN**: In your Wasabi console, enable CDN for the bucket
2. **Benefits**: 
   - Public URLs that work without restrictions
   - Better performance and caching
   - No presigned URL expiration issues

### Option 3: Implement Video Proxy (Current Implementation)
The application now includes:
- ✅ **Automatic presigned URL generation** (8-hour expiration)
- ✅ **URL refresh on expiration**
- ✅ **Error handling and retry logic**
- ✅ **Loading states and user feedback**

## Current Implementation Status

### What's Working
- ✅ Video uploads to Wasabi
- ✅ Database records creation
- ✅ Presigned URL generation (technically)
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback

### What's Not Working
- ❌ Presigned URLs return 403 Forbidden
- ❌ Direct video playback fails
- ❌ Account-level restrictions prevent access

## Immediate Actions Needed

### 1. Contact Wasabi Support

Subject: Enable Public Access for Video Streaming Account

Hello,

I have a Wasabi account and need to enable public access to objects for video streaming in my web application. Currently, I'm getting "Public use of objects is not allowed by this account" errors.

Account details:
- Bucket: clipflow-videos
- Region: us-central-1
- Use case: Video streaming for web application

Could you please enable public access for my account or provide guidance on how to configure this?

Thank you,
[Your Name]
```

### 2. Alternative: Enable CDN
1. Log into Wasabi Console
2. Go to your bucket settings
3. Enable CDN/CloudFront
4. Use CDN URLs instead of direct S3 URLs

### 3. Test After Changes
Once public access is enabled:
1. Test direct video URLs in browser
2. Test presigned URLs
3. Verify video playback in the application

## Technical Details

### Current Video URLs
- **Format**: `https://clipflow-videos.s3.us-central-1.wasabisys.com/user-id/filename.mp4`
- **Status**: 403 Forbidden due to account restrictions

### Presigned URLs
- **Expiration**: 8 hours (Wasabi limit)
- **Status**: Also returning 403 Forbidden
- **Cache**: Implemented with automatic refresh

### Application Features
- **Auto-retry**: Automatically attempts to refresh URLs on errors
- **Loading states**: Shows progress while generating URLs
- **Error handling**: Clear error messages and retry buttons
- **Debug info**: Shows original URLs and status information

## Next Steps
1. **Contact Wasabi support** to enable public access
2. **Test video playback** after account changes
3. **Consider CDN option** for better performance
4. **Monitor URL expiration** and refresh logic

The application is ready - it just needs Wasabi account-level access to be enabled!
